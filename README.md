# SleepCalculator

<strong>Goal</strong>

The main idea is to create an app that calcuates the time slept and determine when to wake up in order to have a good night's sleep.

<strong>Improvement Ideas</strong>

<em>Here are some of the points which I am planning to add / update in the future:</em>

<ul>
<li>Since the app only accepts integers, I want to enable adding minutes for amount of sleep, e.g. 8.5h of sleep.</li>
<li>I want to make a list of countries to choose from and show results in country-specific time formats.</li>
<li>There should be a functionality to let the user know if the amount of sleep was sufficient (less than 7h).</li>
<li>There should be 2 interfaces in the future for the two classes with diffent calculations (hours slept + when to wake up).</li>
<li>Wrong input should be handled in a try...catch block.</li>
<li>Whitespaces beetwen inputs should be made prettier.</li>
<li>Add conversion if writing was false case: SerbiA</li>
<li>hoursSlept() method:calculate time slept with minutes</li>
</ul>

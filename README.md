# SleepCalculator

<strong>Goal</strong>

The main idea is to create an app that calcuates the time slept and determine when to wake up in order to have a good night's sleep.

<strong>Improvement Ideas</strong>

<em>Here are some of the points which I am planning to add / update in the future:</em>


[]Since the app only accepts integers, I want to enable adding minutes for amount of sleep, e.g. 8.5h of sleep.
[]I want to make a list of countries to choose from and show results in country-specific time formats.
[]There should be a functionality to let the user know if the amount of sleep was sufficient (less than 7h).
[]There should be 2 interfaces in the future for the two classes with diffent calculations (hours slept + when to wake up).
[]Wrong input should be handled in a try...catch block.
[]Whitespaces beetwen inputs should be made prettier.
[]Add conversion if writing was false case: SerbiA
[]hoursSlept() method:calculate time slept with minutes
[]Sum of all hours slept per week and average hours slept.

# SleepCalculator

## Goal

The main idea is to create an app that calcuates the time slept and determine when to wake up in order to have a good night's sleep.

#### Improvement Ideas

***Here are some points which I am planning to add / update in the future:***

- [x] Since the app only accepts integers, I want to enable adding minutes for the amount of sleep, e.g. 8.5h of sleep.
- [ ] I want to make a list of countries to choose from and show results in country-specific time formats.
- [ ] There should be a functionality to let the user know if the amount of sleep was sufficient (less than 7h).
- [ ] There should be 2 interfaces in the future for the two classes with different calculations (hours slept + when to wake up).
- [ ] Wrong input should be handled in a try...catch block.
- [ ] Whitespaces between inputs should be made prettier.
- [x] Add conversion if writing was false case: SerbiA
- [ ] hoursSlept() method:calculate time slept with minutes
- [ ] Sum of all hours slept per week and average hours slept.
- [ ] Insert a form for time like ```__:__```
- [ ] Input for numbers should be handled in such way that it accepts "7" and "07.00".
